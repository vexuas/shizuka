Might as well make a list of my projects here. Will eventually make a dedicated site for it but 'tis not today! Should really make an app that's not related to aura kingdom lmao

Sorted by date started

## ak-goats
> A website that shows the location and timings of World Bosses in Vulture's Vale and Blizzard Berg in Aura Kingdom

The one that started it all. Granted the initial idea was so far-fetched and ridiculous that it got scoped down to oblivion. Highly unlikely it'll become the dream app I wanted it to be but who knows ðŸ‘€

## amaterasu
> A discord bot catered to Eidolons for Aura Kingdom

Stemmed from seeing a friend making her official discord bot, Victoria for AKUS. My first bot and honestly had really fun making this one, was initially just a guide for eidolon prayers but thought it'd be best to branch out.
